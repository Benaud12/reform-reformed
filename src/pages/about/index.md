## BROADCASTING THE BEST IN MUSIC, ARTS AND CULTURE FROM MANCHESTER TO THE WORLD.

Starting life in a South Manchester basement in 2013, Reform Radio moved to the Old Granada studios in 2015 and at 7pm on 3rd October, began 24/7 broadcasting of the best in music, arts and culture to the world. Now with support from Allied London as one of their St John's Projects, Reform is ushering in a new era of international broadcasting from this culturally rich region.

Beyond making incredible content, Reform Radio uses the framework of an online station to support young adults into employment. Weâ€™re a not-for-profit company that delivers employment and creative workshops and traineeships alongside genuine opportunities to develop and practice new skills within our industry standard radio station. Our radio community supports the wider community; and so it goes around.

Station enquires including show proposals email Station Manager Robin on\
[studio@reformradio.co.uk](mailto:studio@reformradio.co.uk)

In regards to show proposals, we're not looking to replicate any of the content we currently have on the station, or anywhere else for that matter. We're looking for truly unique, groundbreaking content that challenges the conventions of radio and speaks to an international audience.

Please note we don't have a playlist at Reform Radio, however we are up for hearing new music from artists, especially those who might be up for doing takeovers or looking for bookings at events we are curating. Tracks we like will feature on our own, in house weekly show, Station Team Weekly Meeting, 1pm Wednesdays. Please send these to [music@reformradio.co.uk](mailto:music@reformradio.co.uk) with a download link and link to the track hosted online. Many thanks
